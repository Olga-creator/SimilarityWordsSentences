# **NLP - Similarity with SpaCy (Words and sentences)**

## **About the Project** <a name="project"></a>
This program is used to find similarities between words, sentences and short passages, using Natural Language Processing (NLP). It will compare words or sentences and make prediction of how similar they are. The similarity is shown as a floating decimal from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates 'most dissimilar' and the strength of the similarity increases all the way up to 1.
